# Aerospace Simulation Projects

This repository contains aerospace engineering simulation projects completed during my M.Tech at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

The work spans hypersonic aerodynamics, guidance & control, propulsion, and turbo-machinery, with a focus on physics-based modelling and high-fidelity computational simulations using tools such as OpenFOAM, Python and Matlab.
